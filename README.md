# NaVi - Vi mot Viet Nam khong hoa hoan

### Introduction
This is a demo version of a fire safety training VR application we made for a 36-hour hackathon.

üîéüìñ Here's an overview of how the application works: [Figma](https://scontent.fhan3-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/384491159_264192843246500_4915742775384296547_n.png?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=ae9488&_nc_ohc=77Y4YMhEElkAX_B9ZHf&_nc_ht=scontent.fhan3-2.fna&oh=03_AdRFewOOfRmb1Zl08r_2LMN64RICnSkclcV8LZr4370q9g&oe=65406590)

## Prerequisites

```
git clone https://github.com/maple1606/Navi---Project-for-a-Hackathon.git
```
### üíª Active environment
#### React.js for the front-end demo
```
cd "directory\to\current\github\repo"
npm install
npm run dev
```
#### Python for the back-end model
```
cd "directory\to\current\github\repo"
python make_environment.py
cd "Envir\Scripts"

## Credits
- Linh Phan as the team leader and the product manager.
- Thao Anh as the UI/UX designer.
- Thanh Tam as the marketer.
- Ha Ngo as the back-end developer.
- Minh Tam (me) as the front-end developer.

## Notes for improvement
‚úÖ What's right:
- First time collaborated with a team where each person plays a different role. An eye-opening experience I'd never have had if I'd solely sit at school, truly a breath of fresh air. 
- Learned responsive web design and how to utilize AI-powered chatbots to assist with coding for the first time.
- Learned to communicate with the UI/UX designer throughout the whole process. Also I leanred a lot about UI/UX just by sitting next to her and watching her skillfully handle the job.

‚ùå What's wrong:
- Didn't have a real expert in our team so we couldn't estimate how hard it would ACTUALLY be. Naively assumed we could just focus on generating ideas. But even presenting the demo proved to be much more challenging than I expected. That led to a lot of problems including:
  - Mistakenly overestimated the capability of a mobile phone, leading me to having to build a web front-end demo instead, even though the UI/UX was initially designed for a mobile application.
  - Failed to find a solution for connecting a computer network where the front end resides on one computer and the back-end server on another, more powerful computer.
